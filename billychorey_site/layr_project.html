            <h2>ZVerse Artist Network</h2>
            
            <h3 class="serif">Who is ZVerse?</h3>
            
            <p>ZVerse is an applications company focused on accelerating the creation of meaningful 3D printable content. With the LAYR 3D Content Creation Platform, ZVerse is creating a suite of software applications that make any 2D content 3D printable. Since being founded in 2012, ZVerse’s technology has brought meaningful, high-quality 3D printed content to brands and organizations all over the world. ZVerse is making the world’s content 3D printable.</p>
            
            

            <h3 class="serif">What is the objective of the application?</h3>
            
            <p> As part of their “turnkey” 3D printing service, ZVerse manages a growing 3D artist network. Until now, ZVerse has managed artist interactions on a case-by-case basis. However, one-on-one management isn’t scalable with new business opportunities. The goal of the app is to create a scalable artist network. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="serif">Who is the target audience and what content are they looking for?</h3>
            <p>The target audience includes 3D artists who wish to work with ZVerse. 
            The information and content should enable the artist to view potential projects, keep track of current projects, maintain a library of completed projects, and choose how they are compensated for completed projects.</p>
