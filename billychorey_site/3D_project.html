            <h3 class="serif">Who is 3D Design?</h3>
            
            <p>3D Design is an applications company focused on accelerating the creation of meaningful 3D printable content. With the 3D Content Creation Platform, 3D Design is creating a suite of software applications that make any 2D content 3D printable. Since being founded in 2012, 3D Design's technology has brought meaningful, high-quality 3D printed content to brands and organizations all over the world. 3D Design is making the world’s content 3D printable.</p>
            
            

            <h3 class="serif">What is the objective of the application?</h3>
            
            <p> As part of their “turnkey” 3D printing service, 3D Design manages a growing 3D artist network. Until now, 3D Design has managed artist interactions on a case-by-case basis. However, one-on-one management isn’t scalable with new business opportunities. The goal of the app is to create a scalable artist network. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="serif">Who is the target audience and what content are they looking for?</h3>
            <p>The target audience includes 3D artists who wish to work with 3D Design. 
            The information and content should enable the artist to view potential projects, keep track of current projects, maintain a library of completed projects, and choose how they are compensated for completed projects.</p>

                    <p>An approach to design and development that adapts to the users environment based on screen size, platform, and or orientation. Using flexible layouts and employing appropriate CSS media queries, the design of a responsive site adapts to its environment and conveys its content regardless of screen size. Responsive development eliminates the need to design for individual devices. </p>
